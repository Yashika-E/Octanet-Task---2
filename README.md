# Octanet-Task-2                                                                                TO DO-LIST


I have completed my task 1 from Octanet , the task is to design a "To Do-List" , I have designed an to do-list which has an text field area in which you can type your to do activity and hit on the "add" icon next to
text field to add that particular activity to the list. If you have completed that activity you can just click on to the circle before that task, it will trun checkedin with a green tick mark and the task will be styled
using text decoration : "strikethrough".The unfinished tasks will be left unchecked.You can use the "X" to delete your tasks.If you hit on the add button without entering text in text field , js will prompt an alert 
message to enter any text. And finally for the background I have used linear gradient , the blend of colours.
